You're running a "Buy 2, Get 1 Free" promotion at your store. Your customers can group any 3 consecutive items in their shopping cart, and the cheapest item from every such group of 3 items will be free.

Given a list of prices, your task is to maximize the discount your customer can get.

Example

For prices = [10, 20, 17, 7, 16, 19, 16], the output should be
maxDiscount(prices) = 26.

The customer can group their items as follows: (10, 20, 17), 7, (16,19,16). Thus, they can get a $10 discount from the first group and a $16 discount from the second group, for a total discount of $26.

For prices = [1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 2], the output should be
maxDiscount(prices) = 7.

The customer can group their items as follows: 1, 2, (7, 8, 10), 2. Thus, they can get a $7 discount.
